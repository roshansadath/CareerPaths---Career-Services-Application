# Career Services Application

# Project Description:
The objective of this project is to provide a career services platform where the students (people
looking for jobs) will be able to post and update their portfolio and the employers should be able
to post jobs. With the help of this, you can carry out a job head hunting in your own comfort. This
benefits job-seeking candidates and employers to shortlist their potential job and employee
respectively. This can also help employers find specific candidates as per their requirements along
with job seekers being able to tailor their profile as per the market. All you require is a PC or a
mobile device with Internet to access the website online. To get to this online career services
system all the Students and Employers will create an account and use their email and password
to login. Students will create/modify their profile and will view and apply to job postings.
Employers will create and manage their job posts, review applications from candidates. The login
credentials for this system are under high security and nobody will have the capacity to crack it
easily. Employers will receive notifications when students apply to their job offers, and students
when they are called for interview.
The following are the categories of main users:
1. Employer – create an account/register, login, browse candidates, add job offers, select
candidates that have already applied to an offer for an interview, track the post
2. Student/Candidate – create an account/register, login, and build/upload a resume; browse and
apply for job offers; track applications
3. Admin – Managing all user profiles, postings and tracking
