## **PROJECT DESCRIPTION**
The aim of this project is to establish a career services platform that enables students (individuals seeking employment) to create and update their portfolios while allowing employers to post job opportunities.\
\
 This platform simplifies the process of job hunting, benefiting both job seekers and employers by helping them identify potential matches. It also facilitates targeted candidate searches for employers and allows job seekers to tailor their profiles to align with market requirements. Accessing the platform only requires a computer or mobile device with internet access. To utilize this online career services system, students and employers must create an account using their email and password for login purposes. Students can create or modify their profiles, browse and apply for job postings, while employers can create and manage job posts and review candidate applications.\
\
 The login credentials for this system are highly secure, ensuring the protection of user accounts. Employers receive notifications when students apply for their job offers, and students are notified when they are called for interviews. The main user categories include employers, who can register, log in, browse candidates, add job offers, select candidates for interviews, and track their postings; students/candidates, who can register, log in, create/upload resumes, browse and apply for job offers, and track their applications; and admins, responsible for managing user profiles, postings, and tracking activities.
